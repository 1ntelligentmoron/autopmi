# 1ntelligentMoron's AutoPMI

# What is AutoPMI?
AutoPMI is a tool for Logos IB M23 Cohort (i.e. 21-22 MS3) students to join afternoon Zoom lessons automatically, discarding the need to look up which teacher's class to join, finding the teacher's PMI, and entering the PMI in Zoom. This app is designed for Windows 10 ONLY, with MacOS and Linux support coming much later (perhaps until the features are fully fletched out). If you have any issues using or setting up the program, feel free to DM me in WhatsApp, Discord, or Telegram. Figure how to find me yourself.

Bear in mind that it is your responsibility to ensure that you attend the correct lesson on time, this tool is to simplify the process of which. If you are late because of this tool not working as intended, I cannot do anything to help you.
